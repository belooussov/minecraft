# minecraft

Minecraft server in a docker container, with persistent data volume.

Heavily inspired by [Daniel Limire](https://lemire.me/blog/2016/04/02/setting-up-a-robust-minecraft-server-on-a-raspberry-pi/)
and [overshard](https://github.com/overshard/docker-minecraft).

For now based on Fedora Core, with alpine version to come (eventually).
